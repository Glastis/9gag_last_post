# 9gag_last_post

Here is a bash script that lock in fullscreen with last post of 9gag and it's refreshing every five minutes - still WIP

You need gcc, wget, imagemagick and i3lock for run it.

So for run it;

  `make`
  
  `chmod 775 wget_9gag.sh`
  
  `./wget_9gag.sh`


Default screen size is 1920x1080 but you can change it in wget_9gag.sh
